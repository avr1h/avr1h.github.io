On the eve of February 29, 2024, a friend and I stumbled upon a relic of the past of monumental proportions. An archaeological finding of never-before-seen quality, volume, and sheer authenticity.

Before you are images that have lain dormant for decades, now seen once more. Enter Babynha2000: The Girl Who Pre-Invented Instagram.

A total of 158 PNGs, JPGs, and GIFs were scraped from the archives. (Yes, plural.) Thanks to a myriad of broken links and corrupted files lost to the corrosion of time, I estimate we lost about as much as we found. Although I have personally encountered GeoCities archives featuring pictures of the creator and their friends, archives I'd love to delve into in future posts, I've never found anything close to this order of magnitude. This type of narcissistic self-absorption is often associated with social media, yet predates it by over a decade. In this blog post, I will do my best to examine Babynha2000's behavior and highlight some of the photos I consider to have higher aesthetic value, in hopes of preserving them.

In the words of Babynha2000 herself: **"Clique em qualquer foto abaixo para vÃª-la em seu tamanho original."** (Click on any photo below to see it in its original size.)

esides pictures, Babynha2000 frequently thr usage of GIFs commonly associated with the early 2000s. I decided to include those as well as her custom background for added immersion.
