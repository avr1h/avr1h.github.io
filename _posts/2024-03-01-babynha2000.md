On the eve of the 29th of Febuary, 2024, a friend and I have stumbled upon a relic of the past of monumental proportion. An archeological finding of a never before seen magnitude of quality, volume, and sheer authenticity.

Before you are images who have lain dormant for decades before having eyes set upon them once more. Enter Babynha2000: The Girl who pre-invented Instagram.

A total of 158 PNGs, JPGs, and GIFs were scrapped off of the archive. Thanks to a miriad of broken links and corrupted files lost to the corrosion of time, I estimate we lost about as much as we found.
