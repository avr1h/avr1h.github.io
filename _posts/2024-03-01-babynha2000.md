On the eve of the 29th of Febuary, 2024, a friend and I have stumbled upon a relic of the past of monumental proportion. An archeological finding of a never before seen magnitude of quality, volume, and sheer authenticity.

Before you are images who have lain dormant for decades before having eyes set upon them once more. Enter Babynha2000: The Girl who pre-invented Instagram.

A total of 158 PNGs, JPGs, and GIFs were scraped from the archives. (Yes, plural.) Thanks to a myriad of broken links and corrupted files lost to the corrosion of time, I estimate we lost about as much as we found. Although I have personally encountered GeoCities archives featuring pictures of the creator and their friends, archives I'd love to delve into in future posts, I've never found anything close to this order of magnitude. This type of narcissistic self-absorption predates social media by over a decade. In this blog post, I will do my best to examine Babynha2000's behavior and highlight some of the photos I consider to have higher aesthetic value, in hopes of preserving them.
