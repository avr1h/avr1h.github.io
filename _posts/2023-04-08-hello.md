  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>This will be the website that shall serve me and my cause diligently.</p>
  <p>The previous website was built via your typical drag-and-drop, run of the mill, squarespace-esque website-generator with a ludicrous paywall.</p>
  <p>That will simply not do. I need something more to fully capture the essence of what I am going for.</p>
  <p>Therefore, unlike the previous website, this one will be built from scratch, utilizing languages such as HTML, CSS, YAML, JSON, and other scary terms from the scary world of front-end programming.</p>
  <p>Considering the fact I have zero experience in said front-end programming, this will prove a worthwhile challenge! But who knows, you might be reading this in the far, far-future, where the website is already up and running, complete and fully functioning.</p>
  <p>I assure you however that this is NOT the case in my timeline, the timeline of me writing this very sentence. I wish you could see how bare-bones this looks. Oh well, time to get to work. After all â€” ars longa, vita brevis.</p>
