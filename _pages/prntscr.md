<p>Did you know that every screenshot you take and upload using <a href="https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html">lightshot</a> is kept in their unprotected, completely accessible database?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lightshot-chrome-screenshot-app">"A breach of privacy!"</a> you might cry out. But honestly, what where you expecting from a service that has "index.html" as its homepage url extension?</p>
<p>Roasts aside, although valid, we can take advantage of this exploit to take a somewhat immoral peek into the daily lives of normal, every-day human beings. Just like you and I, I assume. A sort of digital street photography, if you will. Some of these images date as old as over a decade.</p>
<p>The way it works is simple â€” every uploaded screenshot lies behind a url that starts with: "https://prnt.sc/" and adjoined by a combination of letters and numbers about 5-12 digits long.</p>
<p>For example, if we take the <b>avrihh</b>, which is a common mis-latinization of my name, and try to find a screenshot under the same url extension, or simply "id", we will get this:</p>

<div class="row mt-3 text-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/lightshot/avrihh.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

    Notice the exotic file extensions. A quick search will show that most of these relate to programming, with the .BCS and the .OSAV files having to do with video game map design. Using the system's language and the timestamp of which the files were last updated, we can deduce that we are dealing with a Russian-speaking programmer, most likely working on video game modding, circa 2016.

<p>So much extracted from a random image under a random id... In combination with <a href="https://github.com/luizmlo/py-lightshot-dowloader">lightshot-downloader</a> by luizmlo, we can kick our morally dubious expedition to the maximum! <b>Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you to join me on a tour in my museum of digital archeology, where I showcase my most intriging of finds and discoveries!</b></p>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
