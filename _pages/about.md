<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
<p>Upon entering my website, you might ask yourself: "How come you have a website? How come <b>I don't</b> have a website?"</p>
<p>A very valid question indeed. I for one believe that every person should have a website. In an age when vanity is a virtue, and people are rewarded for their narcissistic traits, it is only elementary that the next step in your digital footprint would be to have a whole-ass website dedicated to you and to you alone.</p>
<p>In here, you can get updated on my latest upload, read my blog posts, or work on your eye-contact skills with the image on your right.</p>
<p>Enjoy your stay!</p>
