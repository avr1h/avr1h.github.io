<p>- Tiktoker, documenting the most fake process imaginable and then proceeding to sacrilegiously dub it as "Street Photography."</p>
<p>Street photography has nothing to do with any of that. It's an art. You don't "ask for permission" to do art. Speaking of which, asking permission might just be the most misunderstood concept since quantom physics. As long as I don't make any profit from these photos, I have every right in the world to take a photo in a public space.</p>
<p>As far as I'm conserned, I snapped a photo and you just happened to be there. If something, I should harrass you for ruining <em>MY</em> picture with <em>YOUR</em> ugly mug!</p>
<p>But I'm getting carried away. In reality, it's not that deep. And instead of reading my whining you should just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjuP527Xt2Q">this video</a> of Trevor Wisecup by Paulie B (Good source for street photography knowledge and inspiration, definitely worth checking out the whole channel.)</p>

<p>I obviously can't pretend tto have anything near the skill level of the people featured on the aforementioned YouTube channel. Heck, all of the photos featured on this page were taken on my Samsung Galaxy. And Although I've seen people utilize the settings of the phone to take a RAW photo in combination with an expensive ND filter, I had nothing of that sort. Just my stock phone with the stock settings, for now.</p>
<p>Enough yapping, here are some of the photos I snapped while on a cruise vacation through the Mediterranean:</p>
