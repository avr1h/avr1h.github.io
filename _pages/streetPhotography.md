<p>"Exuse me, I am a street photographer. You look very pretty, can I take your picture?" </p>
<p>- Tiktoker, documenting the most fake proccess imaginable and procceeds to sacriligiously dub it as "Street Photography."</p>
<p>Street photography has nothing to do with any of that. It's an art. You don't "ask for permission" to do art, which by the way, might just be the most idiotic thing an imbecile subject may spout. As long as I don't make a profit from these photos,I have every right in the world to take a photo in a public space.
As far as I'm conserned, I snapped a photo and you just happened to be there. If something, I should harrass you for ruining MY picture with YOUR ugly mug!</p>
<p>But I'm getting carried away. In reality, it's not that deep. And instead of reading my whining you should just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjuP527Xt2Q">this video of Trevor Wisecup by Paulie B</a> (Good source for street photography knowledge and inspiration, definitely worth checking out the whole channel.)</p>

<p>I obviously can't pretend I'm anything near the skill level of the people featured on the aforementioned YouTube channel. Heck, all of these photos were taken on my Samsung Galaxy. And Although I've seen people utilize the RAW mode toghether with an expensive ND Filter, I had nothing of that sort. Just my stock phone with the stock options, sadly.</p>
