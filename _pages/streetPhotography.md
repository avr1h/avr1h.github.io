> Exuse me, I am a street photographer. 
> You look very pretty, 
> may I take your picture?
<p>- A TikToker, whilst documenting the most fake process imaginable and then proceeding to sacrilegiously dub it as "Street Photography."</p>
<p>Street photography has nothing to do with any of that. It's an art. You don't "ask for permission" to do art. Speaking of which, asking permission might just be the most misunderstood concept since quantom physics. As long as I don't make any profit from these photos, or plan to do anything malicious with 'em, I have every right in the world to take a photo in a public space.</p>
<p>As far as I'm conserned, I snapped a photo and you just happened to be there. If something, I should harrass you for ruining <em>MY</em> picture with <em>YOUR</em> ugly mug!</p>
<p>But I'm getting carried away. In reality, it's not that deep. And instead of reading my whining you should just watch this video:</p>

<p>This was one of the videos that convinced me to take my hobby of taking unsolicited photos of other people, something I've been doing since my days in middle schoolâ€”to the wreath of all my friends, a bit more seriously.<br>Trevor Wisecup, the guy in the video, is obviously a good kid. You can tell he's a good kid. His mannerisms, the way he conducts himself, even the way he responded when that douchebag @31:55 minute mark got all up in his face. Which makes him a perfect example to that side of the street photography spectrum.</p>
<p>As for the other side of that spectrum, enter Bruce Gilden:</p>

<p>Ugly, vulgar, and in your face. If Tommy Wisecup, bless his heart, would be the goody-two-shoes of street photography, Bruce Gilden would be on the exact opposite side of that spectrum.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, both are two sides of the same coin. Two examples of a very wide array of an art. </br>I obviously can't pretend to have anything near the amount of skill level of the guys featured here. Heck, all of the photos here (unless mentioned otherwise) were taken on my humble Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough yapping, here are some highlights of my 'work'. You will be able to find these and more with annotations in the subsequent <a href="https://avr1h.com/blog/tag/street-photography">blog posts</a>.</p>
